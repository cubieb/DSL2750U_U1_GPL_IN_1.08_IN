			<p>You can configure filters to manage the incoming and outgoing traffic.

					<dt>Inbound/Outbound Filtering
					<dd>

					<p>When you use port triggering or port forwarding to open ports to traffic from the Internet,
					 the risk of LAN being attacked by hackers from the Internet increases. In this case, 
					 you can use inbound filters to control the risk by specifying the IP addresses of Internet 
					 hosts that you allow to access your LAN through the ports you open. For example, 
					 you can configure the function to allow access to a game server on your LAN from only the 
					 computers of friends whom you invite to play games on that server.</p>
					<p>The inbound filters feature helps to control access to a server on your network
					 so that only a system or group of systems can access the server. 
					 Filter rules can work with the port triggering feature. Each filter can be used for several
					  functions. For example, a "Game Clan" filter can allow all members of a particular gaming 
					  group to play several different games for which gaming entries have been created. Meanwhile,
					   an "Admin" filter can allow only systems from your office network to access the WAN pages 
					   for the "admin" user and an FTP server you use at home. If you add an IP address to a filter,
					    the IP address conforms to all existing rules of the filter.</p>
					<p>The outbound filters feature helps to control access to the Internet by LAN computers. 
					Filters can work with the port forwarding feature. Outbound filter can also be used in 
					conjunction with the inbound filter to allow incoming and restrict outgoing access for gaming 
					over the Internet or file downloading.</p>
					<dt>Bridge Filtering
					<dd>It is also known as MAC address filtering. You can forward or deny incoming traffic 
					based on the source or destination MAC address. Note that bridge filter works with interfaces
					 that are configured as bridge.
