To gain access to a WEP network, you must enter the key, which is a string of characters in HEX (hexadecimal - using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange - alphanumeric characters) format that you create. An ASCII string, which is easier to remember, is converted to HEX for use over the network. When using WEP, you must specify the type of encryption, which determines the length of the key. 128-bit encryption requires a longer key than 64-bit encryption. You can set up to four keys.</p>

Another computer, which serves as an FTP server, is assigned with the static IP address of 192.168.1.4. Therefore, the starting IP address for DHCP IP address range must be 192.168.1.5 or greater.
                  <dt>Example:
                  <dd>Assume that you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199. This means that 192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.99 and 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP server. Computers or devices that use addresses in these ranges are manually configured.
