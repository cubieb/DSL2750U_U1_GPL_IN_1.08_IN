/*
   Bins

    The bins, `av_' are an array of pairs of pointers serving as the
    heads of (initially empty) doubly-linked lists of chunks, laid out
    in a way so that each pair can be treated as if it were in a
    malloc_chunk. (This way, the fd/bk offsets for linking bin heads
    and chunks are the same).

    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically
    spaced. (See the table below.) The `av_' array is never mentioned
    directly in the code, but instead via bin access macros.

    Bin layout:

    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096
     4 bins of size   32768
     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left

    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.

    The special chunks `top' and `last_remainder' get their own bins,
    (this is implemented via yet more trickery with the av_ array),
    although `top' is never properly linked to its bin since it is
    always handled specially.

    Malloc_trim gives memory back to the system (via negative

    the malloc pool. You can call this after freeing large blocks of
    memory to potentially reduce the system-level memory requirements
    of a program. However, it cannot guarantee to reduce memory. Under
    some allocation patterns, some large free blocks of memory will be
    locked between two used chunks, so they cannot be given back to
    the system.

    The `pad' argument to malloc_trim represents the amount of free
    trailing space to leave untrimmed. If this argument is zero,
    only the minimum amount of memory to maintain internal data
    structures will be left (one page or less). Non-zero arguments
    can be supplied to maintain enough trailing space to service
    future expected allocations without having to re-obtain memory
    from the system.

    Malloc_trim returns 1 if it actually released any memory, else 0.

/*
  Malloc Algorthim:

    The requested size is first converted into a usable form, `nb'.
    This currently means to add 4 bytes overhead plus possibly more to
    obtain 8-byte alignment and/or to obtain a size of at least
    MINSIZE (currently 16 bytes), the smallest allocatable size.
    (All fits are considered `exact' if they are within MINSIZE bytes.)

    From there, the first successful of the following steps is taken:

      1. The bin corresponding to the request size is scanned, and if
	 a chunk of exactly the right size is found, it is taken.

      2. The most recently remaindered chunk is used if it is big
	 enough.  This is a form of (roving) first fit, used only in
	 the absence of exact fits. Runs of consecutive requests use
	 the remainder of the chunk used for the previous such request
	 whenever possible. This limited use of a first-fit style
	 allocation strategy tends to give contiguous chunks
	 coextensive lifetimes, which improves locality and can reduce
	 fragmentation in the long run.

      3. Other bins are scanned in increasing size order, using a
	 chunk big enough to fulfill the request, and splitting off
	 any remainder.  This search is strictly by best-fit; i.e.,
	 the smallest (with ties going to approximately the least
	 recently used) chunk that fits is selected.

      4. If large enough, the chunk bordering the end of memory
	 (`top') is split off. (This use of `top' is in accord with
	 the best-fit search rule.  In effect, `top' is treated as
	 larger (and thus less well fitting) than any other available
	 chunk since it can be extended to be as large as necessary
	 (up to system limitations).

      5. If the request size meets the mmap threshold and the
	 system supports mmap, and there are few enough currently
	 allocated mmapped regions, and a call to mmap succeeds,
	 the request is allocated via direct memory mapping.

      6. Otherwise, the top of memory is extended by
	 obtaining more space from the system (normally using sbrk,
	 but definable to anything else via the MORECORE macro).
	 Memory is gathered from the system (in system page-sized
	 units) in a way that allows chunks obtained across different
	 sbrk calls to be consolidated, but does not require
	 contiguous memory. Thus, it should be safe to intersperse
	 mallocs with other sbrk calls.


      All allocations are made from the the `lowest' part of any found
      chunk. (The implementation invariant is that prev_inuse is
      always true of any allocated chunk; i.e., that each allocated
      chunk borders either a previously allocated and still in-use chunk,
      or the base of its memory arena.)

/*

  Realloc algorithm:

    Chunks that were obtained via mmap cannot be extended or shrunk
    unless HAVE_MREMAP is defined, in which case mremap is used.
    Otherwise, if their reallocation is for additional space, they are
    copied.  If for less, they are just left alone.

    Otherwise, if the reallocation is for additional space, and the
    chunk can be extended, it is, else a malloc-copy-free sequence is
    taken.  There are several different ways that a chunk could be
    extended. All are tried:

       * Extending forward into following adjacent free chunk.
       * Shifting backwards, joining preceding adjacent space
       * Both shifting backwards and extending forward.
       * Extending into newly sbrked space

    Unless the #define REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES is set, realloc with a
    size argument of zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.

    If the reallocation is for less space, and the new request is for
    a `small' (<512 bytes) size, then the newly unused space is lopped
    off and freed.

    The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk
    to be used as an argument to realloc is no longer supported.
    I don't know of any programs still relying on this feature,
    and allowing it would also allow too many other incorrect
    usages of realloc to be sensible.
